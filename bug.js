This error occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker library and selecting a file from a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox.  The file path returned by the DocumentPicker is not a local file path, therefore, causing issues when trying to access the file contents directly. The problem stems from the fact that Expo's DocumentPicker returns a URI that points to the file in the cloud, not the file's local storage location on the device. Attempting to read the file using a local file path will lead to the error.
